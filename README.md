# notes-app
This app was created while I was learnig javascript fudamentals from udemy, a course taugh by Andrew Mead. This app covers the 
basic of the arrays and method used in arrays like foreach(), filter(), findIndexOf(),
find() to manipulate the information. This app targets the use of javascript in the brower
and exploits the functionality provided by browser like local storage to store the 
information and display back to user when needed. Explored the data transfer mechanism
across the pages using the browser provided objects like 'location' and 'window' and its properties.
This application also usess the third party library to generate the random number and 
manipulate the date.
